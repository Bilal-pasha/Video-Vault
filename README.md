## Get Started

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. Run database migrations
   ```bash
   npm run migration:run
   ```

4. Start the server
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

### Mobile Setup

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API URL and Google OAuth credentials
   ```

3. Start the app
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
