# Code Style Rules

- Keep imports ordered and grouped (external, internal)
- Prefer explicit return types on exported functions/components
- Avoid `any`; use precise types or generics
- Use enums and constants over string literals (e.g., `DesignationEnum`)
- Keep components small and focused; extract helpers where needed
- No hard-coded API URLs; use constants
- Prefer early returns over deep nesting
- Avoid unnecessary `try/catch`; only where exceptions are expected
- Run Prettier; fix lints before committing
